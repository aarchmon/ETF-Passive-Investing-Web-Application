## Examples

## Usage

1. Clone repository onto your personal machine. 

2. Open _Jupyter Lab_ or _Jupyter Notebook_ via _Anaconda Navigator_ and navigate to the directory in which the file `san_francisco_housing.ipynb` is present. _All relevant code for this repository will be executed via Jupyter Notebook and no output will be printed to the command line_. Ensure that all relevant dependencies and _Python_ modules are installed (see __Technologies__ and __Installation Guide__ for more details) before attempting to execute code within _Jupyter Notebook_; otherwise, you will receive multiple interpreter errors! 

3. With the notebook open, start at the very first cell reading "__Housing Rental Analysis for San Francisco__" (a cell will be active when a rectangular border is surrounding the area in question). Run each cell in sequential order. _It is vital that all cells are ran in sequential order or your notebook will generate compiler errors_!.
